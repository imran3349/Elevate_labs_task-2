# Elevate_labs_task-2
"In this task, we will use sales data (like the Superstore dataset) to craft a visual narrative that highlights key business insights. The goal is not just to present charts, but to tell a storyâ€”what the data reveals about performance, trends, or opportunities. Each visualization should be purposeful, clear, and supported with context, ultimately culminating in a summary that delivers actionable conclusions."
